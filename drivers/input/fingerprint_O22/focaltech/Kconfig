config FINGERPRINT_FOCALTECH
    tristate "FocalTech Fingerprint"
    default n
    help
      If you say Y to this option, support will be included for
      the FocalTech's capacitive or optical fingerprint sensor.
      This driver supports almost all the TEE solutions just like
      QSEE, Trustonic, TrustKernel, Beanpod.., also including
      REE emulation.

      This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
      will be called 'focaltech_fp'.


config FINGERPRINT_FOCALTECH_SPI_SUPPORT
    bool "FocalTech Fingerprint SPI Support"
    default n
    depends on FINGERPRINT_FOCALTECH
    help
        Set Y here if supports SPI communication
        in kernel.
        If unsure, say N.
